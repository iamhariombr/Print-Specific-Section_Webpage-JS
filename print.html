      <p>Coal is a valuable hard, black material extracted from mines. Wood that has been buried for a long time
         becomes coal due to a chemical change. Earthquakes cause vast forest areas to sink underground and contribute to such chan
         ges as a result of tremendous heat and pressure. Coal mines can be found in our country at  Dhanbad, Jharia, Giridih, Chaibasa,
          and other locations. Coal is exported from India to Japan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Coal 
          is used as a fuel in both homes and factories and industries. The majority of trains and steamers
           move by burning coal in steam engines.</p>

        <p>Plastic is a non-biodegradable material. It does not mix with soil and reduces soil fertility. 
            It cannot be automatically recycled and harms the Earthâ€™s life cycle. However, plastic is replacing the traditional use of jute, 
            cotton or paper materials and is becoming a threat to the living world. Children run the risk of suffocation when playing with plastic bags. 
            Coloured plastic carry-bags cause food poisoning. Plastic waste, if not disposed of carefully, often clogs sewage systems.</p>
